Project Overview
Purpose
The primary objective of this project was to create a digital identity that serves as a central hub for my academic work. It moves beyond simple file storage, presenting my coding projects in a visually engaging, professional format suitable for sharing with potential recruiters or peers.

Scope
The portfolio currently features:

Personal Branding: A "Hero" section with a brief introduction and profile visual.
Project Showcase: A sliding carousel displaying three key academic projects:
Basic Calculator: A tool for arithmetic operations.
Boolean Evaluator: A logic-based application.
Data Encryptor: A security-focused utility.
Contact Hub: Direct links to professional networks (GitHub, LinkedIn) and email contact.
Tech Stack
HTML5: Used for semantic structuring (header, section, footer).
CSS3: Used for layout (Flexbox), responsiveness (Media Queries), and visual flair (Gradients, Animations).
Git/GitHub: Used for version control and hosting.
